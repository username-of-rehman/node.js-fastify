# node.js-fastify

Repository Description:

Welcome to our performance-optimized REST API built with a strong emphasis on response time, throughput, and efficient use of resources. Our solution prioritizes minimal third-party dependencies, leverages optimized JavaScript code, and maintains a structured design for ease of development and future scalability.

Key Features:

Performance-Centric Framework:
Utilized the Fastify REST framework for Node.js to ensure rapid response times and high throughput, leveraging its efficiency and performance optimizations.

Efficient Data Processing:
Processed CSV data containing state names, city names, and population, optimizing for speed and efficiency by converting it into a string. Regular expressions (regex) were used for comparisons to minimize complexity and enhance performance.

Minimal Third-Party Dependencies:
Kept the reliance on third-party modules to a minimum, focusing on efficiency and speed by opting for manual implementation using basic utility functions wherever possible.

Optimized JavaScript Code:
Demonstrated proficiency in JavaScript to optimize code, aligning with the objective of achieving high performance without being hindered by convenience features.

Structured and Scalable Design:
Maintained a structured codebase to avoid a monolithic approach, promoting separation of concerns. Modules like data store, routes, data processing, and server were organized for scalability, maintainability, and better readability, allowing for easy development and future expansion.

Fastify version 9.8.1
node version v18.18.0
